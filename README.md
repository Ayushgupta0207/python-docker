Overview

python-docker is a boilerplate project that helps you get started quickly with a Python app containerized using Docker. It provides a consistent structure, ease of dependency management, and supports local development as well as production deployments.

Why Python Docker?

📦 Easy Containerization: Simplifies the process of containerizing Python applications and ensures the application behaves the same across all environments.

💡 Fast New Application Setup: Provides a consistent directory structure for new projects making it easy to start.

🔄 Dependency Management: Uses pip and requirements.txt for managing Python dependencies cleanly and efficiently.

🚀 Optimized Deployment: The Dockerfile is tuned for building small and fast containers, enhancing scalability and efficiency.
